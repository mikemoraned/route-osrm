See http://mikemoraned.github.io/route-osrm/ for an example of combining https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend
and http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/ to find distance between a clicked location and a selection of
areas currently in view.

**Note that this currently uses the free http://map.project-osrm.org/ backend, so may time out or fail if that is overloaded** (I'm working on https://github.com/mikemoraned/osrm-service but that's not ready yet)
